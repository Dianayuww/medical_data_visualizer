ðŸ“Š Project Summary: Medical Data Visualizer
This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing patient data collected during medical examinations. The dataset includes objective measurements such as age, height, and weight, examination results like blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels, as well as lifestyle indicators (smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity).

ðŸ©º Main objectives:

Determine overweight status using Body Mass Index (BMI) calculations.

Normalize medical data for features like cholesterol and glucose to simplify analysis.

Create categorical plots to compare the distribution of health-related behaviors and conditions between patients with and without cardiovascular disease (cardio=1 and cardio=0).

Generate a heatmap to visualize correlations between variables after cleaning the data to remove incorrect or extreme values.

The project utilizes pandas for data processing and seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations. Unit tests are included to ensure each function performs as expected.
